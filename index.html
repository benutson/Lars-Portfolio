 <p class="blue">I'm born in Halmstad, which is placed on the west coast of Sweden. I lived in Halmstad until I was 21 years. First I joined the army for one year in a town named Hässleholm. The next 3 years I studied in Falun which is a nice town in Dalarna.</p>
<p>In 1988 I moved to Stockholm and I'm still living there. Stockholm is a fantastic place if you, like me, love live music</p>
<p class="green">One of my biggest interest is to listen to live music. I have always listen to a lot of music. When I was young I had a tape recorder that used a lot when listening to music. The place to listen to new music was Radio Luxemburg. It was a fantastic place to discover new artists and music genres. I recorded a lot using my tape recorder.</p>
  
<p> In 1983 I attendended a consert in Lund in a consert arena named Olympen. This was the start of my huge interest listening to live music. The main act was the canadian group "SAGA" and the starting act was Chris Rea (who later got quite famous). Ever since I have loved attending live conserts.</p>

<h2> Below a consert that was something extraordinary</h2>
<p>Bruce Springsteen at Ullevi in Gothenburg 1985. They actually had to rebuild the arena after his conserts. The arena started to "move"(oscillations) due to the huge amount of spectators dancing, jumping, having fun.</p>
